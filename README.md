# Solve Sudoku with AI

## Summary

In this project, students will extend the Sudoku-solving agent developed in the classroom lectures to solve _diagonal_ Sudoku puzzles. A diagonal Sudoku puzzle is identical to traditional Sudoku puzzles with the added constraint that the boxes on the two main diagonals of the board must also contain the digits 1-9 in each cell (just like the rows, columns, and 3x3 blocks).

You must have `pygame` installed.
